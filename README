package notes:
* python-pygame (required for SDL dependencies)
* xvfb (raspbian: xvfb; arch: xorg-xvfb-server)
* imagemagick
* numpy on RaspberryPi had .so dependency requiring libatlas-base-dev to be installed

some notes on python color libraries:
* palette hasn't changed in ~10 years and does not support python 3
* colour does not natively support 8-bit scaled colors
* python-colormath has a separate type for each color representation
